  abstract  = {This thesis deals with the implementation of the SUBSCALE algorithm in the Python programming language. First, the current state of research and the needs of the target group are considered. Then, the choice of language is decided based on the findings. On the basis of self-generated requirements, the implementation is carried out. Finally, the code is evaluated for accuracy, consistency, and execution time, as well as its applicability in practice. Since the implementation of the current work proved to be unconvincing, an approach is tested in which Python is used only as a front-end.},
